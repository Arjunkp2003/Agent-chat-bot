Research Assistant with Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit

This project is an AI-powered research assistant that combines the power of Groq’s language models with LangChain and Streamlit. It allows users to interact with multiple knowledge sources such as DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Arxiv, all from a simple web interface.

Features

Uses Groq’s LLaMA 3.1 model for fast and accurate responses

Integrates DuckDuckGo for real-time web search results

Connects to Wikipedia for general knowledge retrieval

Accesses Arxiv for academic research papers

Provides an easy-to-use Streamlit interface

Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Setup

You need a Groq API Key to run this application. Obtain it from the Groq console and set it as an environment variable on your system.

Running the App

After setup, launch the Streamlit application to start interacting with the assistant. The app will run locally and can be accessed through your web browser.

Project Structure

The repository contains the main application file, a requirements.txt for dependencies, and this README for documentation.

Example Use Cases

Summarizing the latest academic papers from Arxiv

Finding updated information on current events using DuckDuckGo

Retrieving background knowledge from Wikipedia

Assisting students, researchers, and professionals with quick answers

Tech Stack

Streamlit for the user interface

LangChain as the framework to connect tools and models

Groq LLaMA 3.1 model as the language backend

DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and Arxiv as external knowledge sources
